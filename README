This a X509 Certificate parser written by means of Wei Dai's cryptopp library. You will see that
the big chunks of X509 Certificate consist of DER Sequences and cryptopp comes at rescue by providing 
the BERSequenceDecoder class which reads a DER sequence and offers access to very useful methods 
like Get, Peek, MaxRetrieval and SkipAll. 

So this parser does nothing else than read sequence by sequence from a X509 Certificate file providing at the end information about :

1. Certificate version
2. Serial number
3. Algorithm type
4. Issuer Name
5. Validity
6. Subject Name
7. Subject Public Key Information 
8. Private Key

So that the above information can be read, this parser provides all important Object Identifier hex byte arrays 
and sequences for information needed in Subject/Issuer Names (i.e. country, state, organizational unit), 
DER Tags and OIDs of the most used encryption algorithms.  

As an example, you may also find a X509 Certificate under the name corleone_certificate.der.

In the future, the parser will also provide information about Certificate Extensions, including, of course, their OIDs.
